# Bridge System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Test Bridges Near Spawn

**Problem**: Claude Opus had created test bridges near the spawn area that needed to be removed.

**Files Disabled**:
- `TestBridgeMeshService.server.luau` → `TestBridgeMeshService.server.luau.disabled`
- `InitBridgeSystem.server.luau` → `InitBridgeSystem.server.luau.disabled`

These files were creating test bridges at:
- Y=100 level near origin (TestBridgeMeshService)
- Y=50 level temporarily (InitBridgeSystem)

### 2. Fixed Bridge Mesh Scaling Issue

**Problem**: Bridge meshes weren't being scaled to 0.04 as intended.

**Root Cause**: In `BridgeMeshService.luau`, line ~334 had this logic:
```lua
if widthScale < 0.1 then widthScale = 1 end
if heightScale < 0.1 then heightScale = 1 end
```

Since the desired scale was 0.04 (which is < 0.1), it was being reset to 1.

**Fix**: Changed the condition to only reset if scale is 0 or negative:
```lua
if widthScale <= 0 then widthScale = 1 end
if heightScale <= 0 then heightScale = 1 end
```

### 3. Created Cleanup Script

**Added**: `CleanupTestBridges.server.luau` - One-time script to remove any existing test bridges from the workspace. It will self-destruct after running.

## Bridge Scaling Now Works Correctly

The bridge scaling system now properly applies the 0.04 scale from `UpdatedBridgeConfig.luau`:

```lua
baseScale = Vector3.new(0.04, 0.04, 0.04)
```

This means:
- Bridge meshes will be scaled down to 4% of their original size
- No more oversized bridges
- Proper proportions maintained

## How to Test

1. Run the cleanup script to remove any existing test bridges
2. Generate sky islands using the SkyIslandGenerator
3. Bridges should now appear at the correct 0.04 scale
4. No test bridges should appear near spawn

## Files Modified

- `src/server/TestBridgeMeshService.server.luau` → disabled
- `src/server/InitBridgeSystem.server.luau` → disabled  
- `src/server/Worldgen/BridgeMeshService.luau` → scaling fix applied
- `CleanupTestBridges.server.luau` → new cleanup script

The bridge system should now work correctly without test bridges cluttering the spawn area and with proper 0.04 scaling applied to all bridge meshes.
