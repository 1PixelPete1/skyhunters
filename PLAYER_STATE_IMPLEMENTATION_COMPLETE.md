## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

```lua
/state - Check current state
/damage [amount] - Test damage
/heal [amount] - Test healing
/giveitem [itemId] [count] - Add to temp bag
/spawnnode [nodeType] - Spawn resource node
/testloot [tableId] [iterations] - Test distribution
/recall - Force start recall
```

## üîß Configuration

All major values are configurable at the top of services:
- `BASE_RECALL_DURATION = 4`
- `BASE_HEARTS = 3`
- `BASE_BAG_SLOTS = 8`
- `HUB_RADIUS = 150`
- `NODE_CHECK_RADIUS = 8`
- `RESPAWN_TIME = 60`

## üìà Next Steps

### **Immediate**
1. Add enemy AI that uses the heart damage system
2. Create more diverse resource node models
3. Add sound effects for all transitions
4. Implement equipment items that modify stats

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Constellation generation with POIs
2. Boss enemies with special loot
3. Multiplayer exploration parties
4. Trading system between players
5. Crafting system using collected resources
6. Seasonal events with special nodes
7. Achievements and progression rewards

## üêõ Known Issues
- Movement speed upgrade persists after state change (needs reset)
- Recall can be started from plot (should be Run only)
- Resource nodes spawn at fixed positions (need dynamic)

## ‚ú® System Ready!

The player state system is now fully functional and integrated with your QuietWinds codebase. Players can explore, collect resources, upgrade their capabilities, and safely return home with their loot. The visual feedback and UI elements make the experience intuitive and engaging.

Test it out by:
1. Walking outside the hub to enter Run state
