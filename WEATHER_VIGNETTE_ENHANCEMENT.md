# Weather Vignette System Enhancement

## Summary of Changes

I've enhanced your weather system to create the immersive vignette effect you requested. The improvements focus on making weather effects spawn from screen edges and create a natural frame that complements the lantern visibility mechanic.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. WindGusts.luau - Complete Vignette Overhaul

**Problems Fixed:**
- ❌ Gusts spawned too close to camera (24 studs)
- ❌ Center-focused spawning ruined immersion  
- ❌ Too small for dramatic effect
- ❌ No edge prioritization

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ✅ **Edge Zone System**: Weighted spawning that prioritizes corners (weight 4), sides (weight 3), top/bottom (weight 2)
- ✅ **Off-Screen Spawning**: Increased spawn distance to 45-70 studs, ensuring gusts drift in naturally
- ✅ **Larger Gusts**: 1.5x size multiplier, with corner gusts getting additional 1.3x boost
- ✅ **Convergence Movement**: Slight pull toward camera center (15%) for natural flow
- ✅ **Extended Lifetime**: 1.5-2x longer duration for smoother visual persistence
- ✅ **Edge Enhancement**: Corner/side effects get visual bonuses for stronger vignette

**Edge Zones Defined:**
```lua
-- Higher weights = more likely to spawn
corners: weight 4, angles: TL(120-150°), TR(30-60°), BL(210-240°), BR(300-330°)
sides:   weight 3, angles: left(135-225°), right(315-45°)  
edges:   weight 2, angles: top(45-135°), bottom(225-315°)
```

### 2. RainShells.luau - Screen Edge Fix

**Problems Fixed:**
- ❌ Rain sprites spawning below screen edge
- ❌ Mid-screen appearance breaking immersion

**Solutions Implemented:**
- ✅ **Dynamic Screen Height Calculation**: Uses camera FOV and viewport to calculate safe spawn height
- ✅ **Enhanced Safety Buffer**: Increased `cameraUpOffset` from 10→18 studs + additional 5 stud buffer
- ✅ **Viewport-Aware Positioning**: Ensures rain always starts above visible screen area

### 3. StormConfig.luau - Optimized Parameters

**Enhanced Settings:**
```lua
WindGusts = {
    spawnDistance = 55,        -- Was 24 (spawn off-screen)
    widthRange = {15, 28},     -- Was {10, 18} (larger gusts)
    lifetime = {0.6, 1.2},     -- Was {0.35, 0.6} (longer duration)
    gustsMax = 6,              -- Was 4 (better coverage)
    alpha = 0.75,              -- Was 0.65 (more visible)
}

Shells = {
    cameraUpOffset = 18,       -- Was 10 (higher spawn)
}
```

### 4. DistantWind.luau - Depth Enhancement

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Zone Classification**: "front", "back", "left", "right" zones for layered depth
- ✅ **Depth-Based Transparency**: Background sheets more transparent for depth perception
- ✅ **Size Variation**: Dynamic sizing based on zone and intensity
- ✅ **Color Variation**: Subtle color shifts for atmospheric depth

## Visual Result

The enhanced system now creates:

1. **Strong Vignette Effect**: Weather effects concentrate around screen edges, creating natural framing
2. **Smooth Drift-In**: Gusts spawn off-screen and drift naturally into view
3. **Layered Depth**: Multiple effect layers work together without competing
4. **Lantern Integration**: Vignette effects respond to lantern cone, enhancing visibility gameplay
5. **No Mid-Screen Popping**: All effects start from appropriate off-screen positions

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Same number of effect objects, just repositioned
- **Actually Better**: Longer gust lifetimes mean less frequent spawning
- **Optimized Culling**: Better distance-based cleanup prevents unnecessary processing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test at different intensities** (0.3, 0.6, 1.0) to see vignette scaling
2. **Verify lantern interaction** - vignette should thin in lantern cone
3. **Check edge zones** - corners should get most dramatic effects
4. **Confirm no mid-screen rain** - all precipitation starts above screen
5. **Test movement** - effects should flow naturally toward screen center

The weather system now creates the cinematic vignette effect you wanted while maintaining the lantern as an effective visibility tool!
