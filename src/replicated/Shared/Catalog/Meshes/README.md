Mesh Templates (optional)

If you cannot set `MeshId` on the server at runtime, place pre-configured `MeshPart` templates here (e.g. a `MeshPart` named `bridge_pone_1` with MeshId and TextureID set). The generator will clone from this folder when available.

Runtime path: `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Catalog/Meshes`
