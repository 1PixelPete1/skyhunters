# LoomDesigner Plugin Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UI Disappearing Problems
- **Problem**: Growth style UI controls would randomly disappear
- **Cause**: Duplicate "Add Branch" buttons and poor state synchronization between `GrowthStylesCore` and `LoomDesigner`
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed duplicate button creation
  - Added proper state synchronization in `updateBranchUI()` function
  - Growth style changes now save back to the selected branch
  - Kind dropdown updates to show current branch's growth type

### 2. Sub-Branch Creation
- **Problem**: No intuitive way to create sub-branches (children)
- **Cause**: Confusing "Attach Child" button that required manual branch creation
- **Fix**:
  - Added "Add Sub-Branch" button that creates and attaches child branches automatically
  - Child branches are named logically (e.g., "trunk_child1", "branch2_child1")
  - Automatically selects the new child branch for immediate editing

### 3. Branch Hierarchy Navigation
- **Problem**: No visibility into branch relationships or easy navigation
- **Fix**:
  - Added hierarchy display in the helper label showing trunk status and children
  - Added "Navigate Hierarchy" button with popup showing:
    - Parent branch (if any)
    - Child branches (if any) 
    - Trunk branch (if not current branch)
  - One-click navigation to any related branch

### 4. Branch Selection State Management
- **Problem**: UI would not properly sync when switching between branches
- **Fix**:
  - Added `updateBranchUI()` function that syncs selected branch data to UI
  - Growth parameters load correctly when switching branches
  - Kind dropdown shows correct current selection
  - UI visibility managed properly (hidden when no branch selected)

## New Features

1. **Intuitive Sub-Branch Creation**: One-click creation of child branches
2. **Branch Hierarchy Display**: Clear view of parent/child relationships
3. **Smart Navigation**: Easy jumping between related branches
4. **Persistent State**: UI remembers and syncs branch configurations correctly
5. **Better Visual Feedback**: Status indicators for trunk branches and child relationships

## Usage Guide

1. **Create a Branch**: Click "Add Branch" to create a new main branch
2. **Edit Branch**: Select from dropdown, configure growth style and parameters
3. **Add Sub-Branches**: Click "Add Sub-Branch" to create children that branch off current branch
4. **Navigate**: Use "Navigate Hierarchy" to jump to parents/children/trunk
5. **Set Trunk**: Use "Set as Trunk" to make current branch the main trunk
6. **Preview**: Changes are applied automatically to the 3D preview

## Configuration Options

- **Growth Styles**: straight, curved, zigzag, sigmoid, chaotic
- **Parameters**: Each style has specific parameters (amplitude, frequency, curvature, etc.)
- **Segment Count**: Control number of segments in each branch
- **Seed**: Control randomization for consistent results
- **Rotation Rules**: Control how branches orient relative to parents

The plugin now provides a complete tree-building experience with proper state management and intuitive controls.
