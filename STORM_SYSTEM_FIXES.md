# Storm System Enhancement - Complete Fix

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Gusts Too Small - Scale 3x and Make Configurable
**Problem**: Wind gusts were too small, appearing as "moving smudges" instead of overwhelming weather.

**Solution**:
- Added configurable `scaleMultiplier` to `StormConfig.DenseStorm` (default: 3.0)
- Updated `WindGusts.luau` to use scale multiplier for:
  - Individual particle billboard sizes (`particle.size * 12 * GUST_SCALE_MULTIPLIER`)
  - Background storm plane sizes (base dimensions × multiplier)
  - Particle spawn rates (spawn rate × multiplier)
  - Tile texture sizes (150 × multiplier)
- Created `StormConfigEditor.luau` utility for easy runtime configuration

**Usage**:
```lua
local StormConfigEditor = require(path.to.StormConfigEditor)
StormConfigEditor.setGustScale(4.0) -- 4x bigger gusts
StormConfigEditor.applyPreset("OVERWHELMING") -- Use preset
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed Particle Rotation and Direction Alignment
**Problem**: Emitted particles (quads) were randomly rotated and didn't fall in the direction of rain/wind.

**Solution**:
- Reduced random rotation in particle emitters from `(-60, 60)` to `(-20, 20)` degrees
- Added wind-aligned particle orientation in `RainShells.luau`:
  ```lua
  local windAngle = math.atan2(windDir.Z, windDir.X)
  local partOrientation = CFrame.new(basePos) * CFrame.Angles(0, windAngle, 0)
  segment.part.CFrame = partOrientation
  
  -- Orient attachment to emit in wind direction + gravity
  local windDownDir = (windDir + Vector3.new(0, -2, 0)).Unit
  segment.attachment.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(Vector3.new(), windDownDir)
  ```
- Added particle size variation for more natural appearance
- Updated particle acceleration to align with wind direction

### 3. ✅ Created Proper Surrounding Air Effect
**Problem**: Previous surrounding quadrant system wasn't visible and didn't scroll properly toward wind direction.

**Solution**:
- Created new `SurroundingAirEffect.luau` with cylindrical sprite arrangement around camera
- Implements the requested behavior:
  - Curved sprites arranged in a circle around the camera
  - Sprites parallel to wind direction (sides) scroll toward wind and fade out
  - Front/back sprites have minimal movement (just subtle sway)
  - Proper fade-out before sprites meet in wind direction
  - Configurable scale multiplier support

**Key Features**:
- **24 sprites in cylindrical arrangement** with 3 distance layers
- **Wind-direction scrolling**: Side sprites move toward wind direction
- **Fade-out system**: Sprites fade as they travel toward wind convergence point
- **Parallax effect**: Multiple distance layers for depth
- **Lantern interaction**: Reduced visibility in lantern cone

### 4. ✅ Fixed Rain Sprite Direction Coordination  
**Problem**: Distant rain sprites didn't follow the same wind direction as beam rains.

**Solution**:
- Updated `DistantWind.luau` to use consistent wind direction from storm state:
  ```lua
  local windDir = state.vector.Magnitude > 0.01 and state.vector.Unit or Vector3.new(0.2, 0, -0.8).Unit
  ```
- Changed jitter motion to align with wind direction instead of camera-relative:
  ```lua
  local windRight = windDir:Cross(up).Unit
  local lateralOffset = (windRight * jitterPrimary + windDir * jitterSecondary * 0.3) * intensity
  ```
- Updated sheet orientation to face wind direction for visual alignment

### 5. ✅ Simplified Background System
**Problem**: Complex 8-direction billboard system in WindGusts wasn't working properly.

**Solution**:
- Simplified `WindGusts.luau` background planes to basic fog effect
- Main surrounding air effect now handled by dedicated `SurroundingAirEffect.luau`
- Cleaner separation of concerns between particle effects and surrounding air

## Files Modified

### Core Storm System
1. **`RainShells.luau`** - Fixed particle orientation:
   - Reduced random rotation from 60° to 20°
   - Added wind-aligned particle emission
   - Added attachment orientation for proper particle direction
   - Added size variation for natural appearance

2. **`SurroundingAirEffect.luau`** - **NEW** curved air effect:
   - Cylindrical arrangement of sprites around camera
   - Wind-direction scrolling with fade-out
   - Multiple distance layers for depth
   - Configurable scale support
   - Lantern cone interaction

3. **`WindGusts.luau`** - Simplified and enhanced:
   - Maintained configurable scale multiplier
   - Simplified background fog planes
   - Focused on particle effects rather than surrounding air

4. **`DistantWind.luau`** - Direction coordination fixes:
   - Made wind direction consistent with rain beams
   - Aligned jitter motion with wind direction
   - Updated sheet orientation for better visual coordination

5. **`EnhancedStormController.client.luau`** - Integration:
   - Added SurroundingAirEffect to storm system
   - Proper initialization and cleanup
   - Update loop integration

### Configuration
6. **`StormConfig.luau`** - Added configuration:
   - `scaleMultiplier: 3.0` in DenseStorm config
   - Configurable scaling for all storm elements

7. **`StormConfigEditor.luau`** - Configuration utility:
   - Runtime configuration functions
   - Preset configurations (SUBTLE, INTENSE, OVERWHELMING, EXTREME, HURRICANE)
   - Easy-to-use API for adjusting storm scale

## Visual Improvements

### Particle Behavior
- **Aligned Emission**: Particles now emit in wind direction + gravity
- **Reduced Chaos**: Less random rotation for more natural rain appearance
- **Size Variation**: Particles have natural size progression throughout lifetime
- **Wind Consistency**: All particle systems use same wind vector

### Surrounding Air Effect
- **Curved Arrangement**: 24 sprites in 3 distance layers around camera
- **Wind Scrolling**: Side sprites scroll toward wind direction and fade
- **Natural Motion**: Front/back sprites have subtle sway without drift
- **Depth Perception**: Multiple layers create proper atmospheric depth
- **Scale Integration**: Respects global scale multiplier for consistent sizing

### Performance Optimization
- **Simplified Background**: Removed complex 8-direction system that wasn't working
- **Efficient Culling**: Distance-based transparency and deactivation
- **Layered Rendering**: Different update rates for different effects
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and pooling systems

## Testing the Changes

### 1. **Particle Direction Test**:
   - Particles should now fall diagonally in wind direction (not randomly rotated)
   - Rain should appear to be blown by the wind consistently

### 2. **Surrounding Air Effect Test**:
   ```lua
   -- Should see curved sprites around camera that:
   -- - Move toward wind direction on the sides
   -- - Fade out before meeting in wind direction  
   -- - Have subtle sway on front/back
   -- - Multiple layers for depth
   ```

### 3. **Scale Configuration Test**:
   ```lua
   local StormConfigEditor = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Shared.StormConfigEditor)
   StormConfigEditor.applyPreset("EXTREME") -- 4x scale
   StormConfigEditor.setGustScale(2.0) -- Custom 2x scale
   StormConfigEditor.resetGustScale() -- Back to 3x default
   ```

### 4. **Direction Coordination Test**:
   - All storm elements (rain beams, distant wind, particles, air effect) should move in same direction
   - Wind motion should appear consistent across all storm systems

### 5. **Lantern Interaction Test**:
   - Storm effects should be greatly reduced in lantern light cone
   - Surrounding air effect should fade in lantern area
   - Particles should have reduced visibility when lantern is active

## Summary

All requested issues have been resolved:
- ✅ **Gusts scaled up 3x (configurable)**
- ✅ **Fixed particle rotation and wind alignment**  
- ✅ **Created proper surrounding curved air effect with wind-direction scrolling**
- ✅ **Fixed rain sprite direction coordination**
- ✅ **Simplified and optimized background systems**

The storm system now provides an overwhelming, immersive weather experience with:
- **Consistent wind behavior** across all elements
- **Proper particle orientation** that follows wind direction
- **Curved surrounding air effect** that scrolls toward wind and fades naturally
- **Configurable scaling** for easy adjustment
- **Performance optimization** with simplified background systems

The new surrounding air effect creates the exact behavior you requested: curved sprites around the camera where the sides parallel to wind direction scroll toward the wind and fade out before meeting, creating a natural wind tunnel effect.
