## Branching

Growth profiles can declare their own children. Each profile's `children` field is
an array of entries describing which profiles to spawn and how to place them.

```lua
profiles = {
  trunk = {
    kind = "curved",
    children = {
      { name = "branchA", count = 2, placement = "tip", rotation = "upright" },
      { name = "branchB", count = 1, placement = "junction", rotation = "inherit" },
    },
  },
  branchA = { kind = "zigzag" },
  branchB = { kind = "straight" },
}

branchAssignments = {
  trunkProfile = "trunk",
  branchCap = 2,
}
```

Each child entry specifies a profile `name`, spawn `count`, and optional `placement`
and `rotation`. The `GrowthVisualizer` walks this hierarchy, spawning branches
according to the rules of each parent profile.
