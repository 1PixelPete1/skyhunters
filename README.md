## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "skyhunters.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `skyhunters.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

## Branching

Growth profiles can declare their own children. Each profile's `children` field is
an array of entries describing which profiles to spawn and how to place them.

```lua
profiles = {
  trunk = {
    kind = "curved",
    children = {
      { name = "branchA", count = 2, placement = "tip", rotation = "upright" },
      { name = "branchB", count = 1, placement = "junction", rotation = "inherit" },
    },
  },
  branchA = { kind = "zigzag" },
  branchB = { kind = "straight" },
}

branchAssignments = {
  trunkProfile = "trunk",
  branchCap = 2,
}
```

Each child entry specifies a profile `name`, spawn `count`, and optional `placement`
and `rotation`. The `GrowthVisualizer` walks this hierarchy, spawning branches
according to the rules of each parent profile.

### Depth progression

Branches track how far they are from the trunk using a `depth` counter. The
trunk starts at depth `0` and each child increases this depth by `1`.
`branchDepthMax` limits how deep the hierarchy can grow.

Profiles can provide different child rules for each depth by indexing the
`children` table with the parent's depth:

```lua
profiles = {
  trunk = {
    kind = "curved",
    children = {
      [0] = { -- depth 0 parents spawn branches at depth 1
        { name = "branchA", count = 2 },
      },
      [1] = { -- depth 1 parents spawn branches at depth 2
        { name = "branchB", count = 1 },
      },
    },
  },
  branchA = { kind = "zigzag" },
  branchB = { kind = "straight" },
}

branchAssignments = {
  trunkProfile = "trunk",
  branchCap = 2,
}
```

In this example, the trunk (depth 0) grows two `branchA` chains at depth 1.
Each `branchA` then follows the `[1]` rules, producing one `branchB` at depth 2.


```
